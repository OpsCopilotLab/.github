# OpsCopilotLab
Production-grade patterns for **AI Copilots + Cloud Ops**: RAG systems, secure networking, observability, and backup/restore evidence.

## What we ship
- **RAG Copilots** with citations, source traceability, and gap-logging (unanswered questions → improvements)
- **Ops/Evidence Factory**: change packets, baselines, restore drills, and audit-friendly documentation
- **Secure Lab + Small Enterprise Blueprints**: segmentation, remote access, least privilege, reproducible setups

## Start here (public)
- **home-lab-architecture** → reference architecture + diagrams + runbooks (sanitized)
- **ops-evidence-factory** → templates + example “receipts” using fake data
- **station-desk-side-chat** → demo RAG pipeline with sample docs + citations + gap log

## Private (internal)
- **ops-factory** → real runbooks, real change packets, real device records (no secrets in git)

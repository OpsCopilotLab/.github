## 🚀 What We Deliver

- **AI DevOps Pipelines** → CI/CD + MLOps workflows to take AI from notebook to production.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems** → context-aware assistants for knowledge-intensive teams.  
- **Smart-Space & IoT Blueprints** → future-ready designs for connected, sustainable environments.  
- **Data, Backup & Observability Frameworks** → enterprise patterns for reliability, security, and insight.  
- **Zero-Trust Networking** → modern firewall & segmentation patterns for secure labs and enterprises.

## 🧩 Solution Suites

We package our work into **modular repos** that can be deployed, extended, or adapted to your needs:

- [`home-lab-architecture`](#) → Reference architecture & Infrastructure-as-Code for modular labs and enterprises.  
- [`fire-dept-rag`](#) → RAG-powered assistant for first responders, knowledge bases, and training.  
- [`ai-devops-toolkit`](#) → End-to-end DevOps/MLOps stack for AI model lifecycle management.  
- [`opnsense-blueprints`](#) → Zero-Trust firewall, VLAN segmentation, and remote access patterns.  
- [`synology-backup-ops`](#) → Synology ABB + 3-2-1 backup & disaster recovery templates.  

Each repo is structured to be **production-ready** with:  
- Demo scripts 🧪  
- Docker Compose stacks 🐳  
- Sample data 📊  
- Deployment notes 📓

## 🔬 Case Labs

We maintain **reference labs** to demonstrate solutions in real contexts:

- **Kingston Home Lab** → a modular, production-grade reference environment with VLANs, NAS, firewalls, and AI nodes.  
- **Fire Dept PoC** → `fire-dept-rag` + `FireMint` node, supporting offline/edge knowledge bases for first responders.  
- **Smart-Space Prototypes** → IoT & AI-driven layouts for property and co-living environments.  

These labs act as **blueprints** for both personal experimentation and enterprise consulting.

# OpsCopilotLab
Production-grade patterns for **AI Copilots + Cloud Ops**: RAG systems, secure networking, observability, and backup/restore evidence.

## What we ship
- **RAG Copilots** with citations, source traceability, and gap-logging (unanswered questions → improvements)
- **Ops/Evidence Factory**: change packets, baselines, restore drills, and audit-friendly documentation
- **Secure Lab + Small Enterprise Blueprints**: segmentation, remote access, least privilege, reproducible setups

## Start here (public)
- **home-lab-architecture** → reference architecture + diagrams + runbooks (sanitized)
- **ops-evidence-factory** → templates + example “receipts” using fake data
- **station-desk-side-chat** → demo RAG pipeline with sample docs + citations + gap log

## Private (internal)
- **ops-factory** → real runbooks, real change packets, real device records (no secrets in git)

# OpsCopilotLab

Production-grade patterns for **AI Copilots + Cloud Ops** — RAG systems, secure networking, observability, and backup/restore evidence.

Most “AI demos” are toys. We ship like the system matters: **traceability, change control, restore drills, and audit-friendly receipts**.

## What we ship
- **RAG Copilots** with citations, source traceability, and **gap logging** (unanswered questions → improvements)
- **Ops / Evidence Factory**: change packets, baselines, restore drills, and repeatable documentation
- **Secure Lab + Small Enterprise Blueprints**: segmentation, remote access, least privilege, reproducible setups

## Start here (public)
- **home-lab-architecture** → sanitized reference architecture, diagrams, ADRs, runbooks  
- **ops-evidence-factory** → templates + example “receipts” using fake data  
- **station-desk-side-chat** → demo RAG pipeline with sample docs, citations, and a gap log loop  

## Private (internal)
- **ops-factory** → real runbooks, real change packets, real device records (**no secrets in git**)

## Principles (non-negotiable)
- **No secrets in Git.** Secrets live in Proton/1Password. Git stores references (e.g., “see Proton note XYZ”).
- **Evidence or it didn’t happen.** Every change gets a receipt: what changed, why, proof, rollback, restore check.
- **Sanitized by default.** Public repos never contain real IPs, VPN configs, firewall exports, or access paths.
